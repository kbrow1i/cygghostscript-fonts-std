Subject: urw-base35-fonts 20170801-2

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* urw-base35-fonts-20170801-2

This package, which used to be called "ghostscript-fonts-std",
contains the 35 fonts in the PostScript Level 2 Core Font Set.  These
fonts are used by ghostscript and xpdf.

This is a rebuild of the 20170801-1 package, in which I have added the
font files /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/*.pfb from the old
ghostscrpt-fonts-std package.  These seem to be needed by xpdf.
