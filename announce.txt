The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* urw-base35-fonts-20170801-5
* urw-base35-fonts-legacy-20170801-5

This package contains the 35 fonts in the PostScript Level 2 Core Font
Set.  These fonts are used by ghostscript, xpdf, and other
applications.

The urw-base35-fonts-legacy package is new with this release.  It
contains older versions of the fonts that are still needed by some
applications, such as xfig.

This should fix the problem reported here:
