The following package has been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* urw-base35-fonts-20170801-3

This package contains the 35 fonts in the PostScript Level 2 Core Font
Set.  These fonts are used by ghostscript and xpdf.

This release removes a workaround for an xpdf problem that has now
been fixed properly.
